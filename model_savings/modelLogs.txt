#first shape test: 'test_diff_touchpoints'
#second shape test: 'test_shape_2'
   #resuts in parameters of shape that are comparable to the true shape parameters
   #However, relatively inaccurate

#third shape test: 'test_shape_3'
   #results in weird shape parameters
   #However, relatively high accuracy??
   #Not clear what changed from 2 to 3 (some transformation definitions in stan file)

#third shape test: 'test_shape_4'
   #Changed to _shaped -> error in data generation until here
#fourth shape test: 'test_shape_5'
   #Without *2

#test_shape_5
   #change prior from N (0,1) to ()

#test_shape_6
   #change of tp_3 from S:3.5, H:5,2 to 3 , 1.9

#test_shape_7
   #only kept TP_4
